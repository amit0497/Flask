**What is a Web Framework?**

A Web Application Framework or simply a Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enable web application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level details such as protocol, thread management, and so on.

Flask is called a "micro" framework because it doesn't directly provide features like form validation, database abstraction, authentication, etc.
